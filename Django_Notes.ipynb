    "- Another folder called `myproject`: this is a Python package that contains important files for our project.     \n",
    "- A file named `manage.py`: this is a file executed from the command line to interact with our project. This file is used to start the Django server. This file is not mapped in our system path, like `django-admin`, because of that we need to run it using Python.  \n",
    "To execute this file we need to enter our project folder and run:  \n",
    "`python manage.py runserver`.  \n",
    "The use of manage.py in this manner is called generally *management command*, in this specific case *runserver management command*."
